# how-browsers-work



The Basic Process on how browsers work involves typing in a URL(uniform resource locator) into your browser and pressing return. Your browser forms a connection to a Web server and requests a page .It receives it and the page pops up on your screen.

We will explore intrinsically what happens behind the scenes in your browser from when you type in the URL in the address bar until you see the requested page on the browser screen.
