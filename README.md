####WHAT YOU SHOULD KNOW BEFORE WE GET STARTED!

A web browser, or simply ‘browser’, is a software application whose main function is to present the web resource you choose by requesting it from the server and displaying it on the browser window.

The resource format is usually HTML but can also be in PDF, image, video and more. The location of the resource is specified by the user using a URL. When you navigate to a URL in the address bar you are making a “request” for the content at that URL.

Common web browsers include; Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and Opera. Browsers' have user interfaces that have a lot in common with each other.

**The common user interface elements are:**

 
- _Address bar for inserting the URL_
- _Back , forward ,refresh and home buttons_
- _Bookmarking option_
